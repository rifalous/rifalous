## Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm [**Rifal**](httos://github.com/rifalous). I can make life very awkward, but in a good way. I am good at creating problems and suggesting high level conspiracies. Occasionally, I curse. Every now and then, when it's necessary, I can even pretend that I have a brilliant mind!

> For as long as we can remember, magic has been a part of our lives. And we've found that magic powers are always a part of everyday life â€” even if you're not a wizard yourself! After all, it's not magic without the power to make it happen.


> P.S. : I'm a proud Gryffindor. here's a picture of The Hogwarts Founders, also known as the Hogwarts Four.
